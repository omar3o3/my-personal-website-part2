# My personal website

This is my first attempt at creating a website.

I am combining the knowledge I gained from flatiron's prework lessons
and knowledge I gained through googling information as I needed it.

The layout for this website/portfolio was inspired by different examples I
found on google images.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
